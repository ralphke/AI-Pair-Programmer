## Initial Prompt
# Create a web API using FastAPI with a route to products.
# Add logic to fetch and return products
# add functions for a product to be: created, updated, inserted, deleted
# add a connection to the local SQL-Server database
# Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries
# Execute SQL query to fetch a single product by ID passed as a parameter
# Return the product details
# add code for error handling to each step, such as database connection errors and query execution errors
# Additional CRUD operations (create, update, delete) would follow a similar pattern
