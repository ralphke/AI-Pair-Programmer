## Language Translation

### Description

Sometimes, developers may need to translate code from one language to another, such as from Python to C# or HTML to Markdown. This is where GitHub Copilot shines as a virtual aide. Imagine a scenario where a team is working on a multi-platform project, and they need to quickly convert a Python algorithm into C# for web integration. GitHub Copilot's Language Translation ability can save hours of manual translation, enabling seamless cross-language development.

#### Example

Here's an example of translating a Python function into C#:

Python code:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

Using GitHub Copilot, we can effortlessly translate it into C#:

```C#
public int Add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

### Exercise

- **Exercise 1**: Translate a simple HTML structure into Markdown using GitHub Copilot.
- **Exercise 2**: Convert a given Python class into its equivalent C# representation.
- **Exercise 3**: Write a C# function and then translate it into Python using GitHub Copilot.
