## GitHub Copilot Shortcuts

### Description

GitHub Copilot provides developers with a set of **keyboard shortcuts** to accelerate the coding process. These shortcuts make the navigation and interaction with GitHub Copilot's AI-driven suggestions more intuitive and efficient. In this pattern, we will explore the keyboard shortcuts that are essential for rapid code development with Copilot.

#### Example

For example, to accept a suggestion from Copilot, you can simply press the `TAB` key. Here's a list of some key shortcuts:

- Accept suggestion: `TAB` key
- Reject suggestion: `Esc` key
- Show combined suggestions: `Ctrl` + `Enter` key
- Accept at word level: `Ctrl` + `Right Arrow` key
- See next suggestion: `Alt` + `]` key
- See previous suggestion: `Alt` + `[` key
- Trigger inline suggestion: `Ctrl` + `k` + `i` key
- Show Labs feature list: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Alt` + `e` key
- Toggle sidebar: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `a` key

### Exercise

- **Exercise 1**: Try using the `TAB` key to accept a Copilot suggestion in your current project. How does it feel?
- **Exercise 2**: Press `Esc` key to reject a suggestion. What happens?
- **Exercise 3**: Use `Ctrl` + `Enter` key to see combined suggestions. Explore them and identify a useful one.
- **Exercise 4**: Navigate through the suggestions using `Alt` + `]` and `Alt` + `[` keys. How does it affect your code selection process?
- **Exercise 5**: Experiment with the other shortcuts listed above and describe your experience with each of them.

### Checklist for Further Learning

- Have I internalized the shortcuts for accepting and rejecting Copilot suggestions?
- Am I comfortable using shortcuts to navigate through multiple suggestions?
- What other shortcuts within VSCode can enhance my coding experience with Copilot?
- How can I customize the shortcuts to suit my personal coding workflow?
- Could the use of these shortcuts help me in other coding environments or only in Visual Studio Code with Copilot?
