This C# code defines a class named [`Program`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22Program.cs%22%2C%22Program%22%5D "Program.cs") which contains the [`Main`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22Program.cs%22%2C%22Main%22%5D "Program.cs") method. The [`Main`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22Program.cs%22%2C%22Main%22%5D "Program.cs") method is the entry point of a C# console application. When the application is started, the [`Main`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22Program.cs%22%2C%22Main%22%5D "Program.cs") method is the first method that gets called.

The [`Main`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22Program.cs%22%2C%22Main%22%5D "Program.cs") method in this code takes an array of strings as an argument, typically referred to as `args`. These are command-line arguments that can be passed when the application is run from a command line interface (like a terminal or command prompt). 

The code first checks if any arguments were passed to the application by checking the length of the `args` array. If its length is 0, it means no arguments were passed. In this case, the program prints a message "No arguments were passed" to the console and then exits the [`Main`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22Program.cs%22%2C%22Main%22%5D "Program.cs") method using the `return` statement.

If the length of `args` is not 0, it means one or more arguments were passed. The program then prints a message "Arguments passed were: " to the console. After that, it prints all the arguments that were passed. The `string.Join(", ", args)` statement is used to concatenate all the arguments into a single string, with each argument separated by a comma and a space. This concatenated string is then printed to the console.

In summary, this program is a simple command-line application that checks if any arguments were passed to it and then prints those arguments. If no arguments were passed, it informs the user and exits.
