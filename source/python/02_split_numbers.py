# Propmpt:
# The code should analyze a string containing any amount of characters which can be either a letter or a digit. If there is a number with more than 1 digit, this should be counted as a whole number - not as separate digits.
# The goal is to get the summ of all the numbers in the string.
# Please create the correct python code for this.

    # Find all numbers in the string
    numbers = re.findall(r'\d+', input_string)

    # Convert the numbers to integers and sum them up
    return sum(map(int, numbers))

# Given string

# Explanation:
## Regular Expression: \d+ is used to find sequences of digits (whole numbers) in the string.
## re.findall: This method returns all occurrences of the pattern in the string as a list.
## Summation: The found numbers are converted to integers and summed up.
